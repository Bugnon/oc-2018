   builder
      A class (inheriting from :class:`~sphinx.builders.Builder`) that takes
      parsed documents and performs an action on them.  Normally, builders
      translate the documents to an output format, but it is also possible to
      use the builder builders that e.g. check for broken links in the
      documentation, or build coverage information.

      See :doc:`glossary` for an overview over Sphinx's built-in
      builders.

   configuration directory
      The directory containing :file:`conf.py`.  By default, this is the same as
      the :term:`source directory`, but can be set differently with the **-c**
      command-line option.
   source directory
      The directory which, including its subdirectories, contains all source
      files for one Sphinx project.

   reStructuredText
      An easy-to-read, what-you-see-is-what-you-get plaintext markup syntax and
      parser system.
